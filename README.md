# ATENEA-PROJECT

### What is it?

A little data-management and data-collection to make little data-bases and study the data.

Mainly made with Python and sqlAlchemy.

### How does it work?

It generates random IPs and then ipinfo scans them and inserts the data inside a db, which later can be dumped in a .csv file.

### What can I learn with this?

You can learn simple data base structure, querying, plotting locations and basically how it works.

### How do I install the requirements?

Just type in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need to have an https://ipinfo.io token if you want to have the 100% functionality.
